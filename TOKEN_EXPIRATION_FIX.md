# Token Expiration Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
When a user's authentication token expired during a logged-in session, the application was showing 401 errors in the network tab but not redirecting the user to the login page.

## Solution
Implemented axios interceptors in the API service to automatically handle token expiration by:
1. Catching all 401 (Unauthorized) responses
2. Clearing authentication data from localStorage
3. Redirecting the user to the login page

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Service (src/services/api.js)
Added two interceptors:

#### Request Interceptor
- Automatically adds the authentication token to all API requests
- Adds the secret key header to all requests
- Eliminates the need to manually add these headers in every component

#### Response Interceptor
- Intercepts all API responses
- Detects 401 (Unauthorized) errors
- Clears all authentication data from localStorage:
  - token
  - role
  - email
  - userId
  - phoneNumber
  - photo
  - balance
- Redirects user to `/login` page

### 2. Updated All Components Using Axios
Migrated 11 components from using `axios` directly to using the `API` instance:

1. **Profile.js** - User profile display
2. **UserList.js** - Admin user list with search
3. **TransactionList.js** - Admin transaction list
4. **UserProfile.js** - Admin user profile view/edit
5. **CreateUser.js** - Admin create user form
6. **SelfStatement.js** - User transaction history
7. **SendMoney.js** - Send money transaction
8. **Withdraw.js** - Withdraw money transaction
9. **Deposit.js** - Deposit money transaction
10. **Payment.js** - Make payment transaction

Note: **Login.js** was intentionally not changed as it makes unauthenticated requests.

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Centralized Error Handling**: All 401 errors are handled in one place
2. **Automatic Token Management**: No need to manually add headers in each component
3. **Better User Experience**: Users are immediately redirected to login instead of seeing errors
4. **Security**: All authentication data is cleared when token expires
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to manage authentication logic in the future

## How It Works

1. User makes an API request through any component
2. Request interceptor adds the token and secret key automatically
3. If the token is expired, the server returns a 401 status
4. Response interceptor catches the 401 error
5. All auth data is cleared from localStorage
6. User is redirected to the login page
7. User can log in again with fresh credentials

## Testing Recommendations

To test this implementation:
1. Log in to the application
2. Manually expire or delete the token from localStorage (or wait for it to naturally expire)
3. Try to perform any action that requires API calls
4. Verify that you are automatically redirected to the login page
5. Verify that all localStorage data has been cleared

## Additional Notes

- The solution uses `window.location.replace()` for immediate redirection without adding to browser history
- All components now use relative URLs (e.g., `/user/list`) instead of full URLs
- The interceptor returns a never-resolving promise after redirect to prevent further code execution
- This prevents the brief moment where a component might try to render with empty data during redirect

## Important Implementation Detail

The response interceptor returns `new Promise(() => {})` (a promise that never resolves) after initiating the redirect. This is crucial because:
1. It prevents the catch block in components from executing
2. It stops any component rendering that might happen during the redirect
3. It ensures a clean transition to the login page without showing empty data
